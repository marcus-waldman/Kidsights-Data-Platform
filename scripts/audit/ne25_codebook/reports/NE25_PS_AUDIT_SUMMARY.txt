EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
Status: HIGH PRIORITY
Total PS Items Audited: 46
Critical Issues: 0 (0%)
High Priority Issues: 46 (100%)
Items Missing Labels: 46 (100%)

KEY FINDINGS
------------
✓ REDCap Source: All 46 PS items have proper response options
  Format: 0,Never or Almost Never | 1,Sometimes | 2,Often | 9,Don't Know

✓ Codebook: All 46 PS items have ps_frequency_ne25 response set
  Values: 0,1,2,9 with correct labels and missing flag for 9

✗ Dictionary: All 46 PS items have empty value_labels '{}'
  Data Type: Stored as 'numeric' instead of 'factor'
  Missing Rate: ~43.8% (consistent across all PS items)

✓ Value/Label Consistency: REDCap and Codebook are 100% aligned
  All 46 items have identical values and labels between sources

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
-------------------
The issue appears to be in the pipeline transformation process:
1. REDCap API correctly provides response options
2. Codebook correctly defines expected response sets
3. Dictionary generation fails to apply response labels

Likely causes:
- PS items stored as 'numeric' instead of 'factor' type
- Response set definitions not applied during transformation
- Pipeline may be processing PS items differently than other variables

IMPACT ASSESSMENT
-----------------
Severity: HIGH
Impact: Users cannot interpret PS item responses properly
Affected: All 46 PS items (psychosocial development measures)
Data Integrity: Values are correct, labels are missing

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. IMMEDIATE: Investigate why PS items lose response labels in pipeline
2. TECHNICAL: Ensure PS items are processed as factors with proper levels
3. VALIDATION: Add pipeline checks to verify response labels are preserved
4. MONITORING: Include label completeness in regular data quality checks
