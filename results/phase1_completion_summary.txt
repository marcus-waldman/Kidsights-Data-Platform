AUTHENTICITY SCREENING - PHASE 1 COMPLETION SUMMARY
================================================

Date: 2025-11-07
Status: COMPLETE ✓

## Data Extracted

### Items - Initial Extraction (J = 276)
- Binary items: 168 (2 categories)
- Polytomous items: 4 (3-6 categories)
  - 3 categories: 1 item
  - 5 categories: 2 items
  - 6 categories: 1 item
- Unknown type (no response_sets): 104 items

### Items - Validated for Modeling (J = 172)
- **Using only validated items** with response_sets in codebook
- Binary items: 168 (2 categories)
- Polytomous items: 4 (3-6 categories)
- **Excluded:** 104 derived variables without response_sets
- **GitHub Issue #4:** Investigate why 104 items with lex_equate lack validation

### Training Set (Authentic Participants)
- N = 2,635 persons
- M = 201,969 non-missing observations
- Average responses per person: 76.6 items
- Age range: [0.0, 6.0] years
- Response value range: [0, 9]

### Test Set (Inauthentic Participants)
- N = 872 persons
- M = 16,413 non-missing observations
- Average responses per person: 18.8 items
- Age range: [0.0, 6.0] years
- Response value range: [0, 9]

## Key Findings

1. **Response Rate Disparity:** Inauthentic participants completed 4x fewer items than authentic (18.8 vs 76.6 avg). This suggests survey completion rate is a strong authenticity signal.

2. **Response Values:** Observed range [0-9] indicates some items have responses beyond expected categories (e.g., 9 = "Prefer not to answer"). The Stan model will need to handle this or we should pre-filter to valid ranges.

3. **Item Coverage:** All 276 items from codebook exist in database. Good coverage for modeling.

4. **Age Distribution:** Both groups span full 0-6 year range, enabling age-based modeling.

## Outputs Created

✓ data/temp/item_metadata.rds
  - Item mappings (NE25 → lex_equate)
  - Item types (binary/polytomous)
  - Category counts (K vector)

✓ data/temp/stan_data_authentic.rds
  - Vectorized training data
  - Lists: M, N, J, yvec, ivec, jvec, age, K, pid, item_names

✓ data/temp/stan_data_inauthentic.rds
  - Vectorized test data
  - Same structure as training data

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Write Stan model with:
   - Equal-spaced thresholds (τ[j] + k*δ)
   - Item-specific age slopes (β₁[j])
   - Person random effects (η[i] ~ N(0, σ²))
   - Half student-t priors for δ and σ

2. Test model on subset before full fit

3. Fit full model on 2,635 authentic participants

4. Validate convergence and parameter estimates

## Potential Issues to Address

1. **✓ RESOLVED: Response value 9 and unknown items** - Using only 172 validated items eliminates this issue

2. **Need to re-vectorize with validated items only** - Current stan_data uses all 276 items, need to regenerate with 172

3. **Sparse data for inauthentic:** Only 18.8 items/person may lead to unstable person effect estimates. Consider pooling or hierarchical structure.

4. **Computational load:** With 172 items instead of 276, this should be more manageable for L-BFGS and LOOCV.
