# NE25 Imputation Configuration
# Study-specific configuration for Nebraska 2025 imputation pipeline

# Study identification
study_id: "ne25"
study_name: "Nebraska 2025"

# Study-specific paths (relative to project root)
data_dir: "data/imputation/ne25"
scripts_dir: "scripts/imputation/ne25"

# Database table prefix (creates tables like: ne25_imputed_female, ne25_imputed_puma, etc.)
table_prefix: "ne25_imputed"

# Number of imputations to generate (M)
# Start small (M=5) for testing, scale up to M=20+ for production
n_imputations: 5

# Random seed for reproducibility
# Set to null for different imputations each run
random_seed: 42

# Geography imputation settings
geography:
  # Geographic variables to impute
  variables:
    - puma
    - county
    - census_tract

  # Method for sampling geography assignments
  method: "probabilistic_allocation"  # Uses afact as sampling weights

  # Minimum afact threshold to include a geography candidate
  # Set to 0 to include all possible assignments
  min_afact: 0.0

# Sociodemographic imputation settings (CART + Random Forest via mice)
sociodemographic:
  # Variables to impute
  variables:
    - female       # Child is female (binary: TRUE/FALSE) - ~39% missing
    - raceG        # Child's race/ethnicity grouped (7 categories) - ~40% missing
    - educ_mom     # Maternal education (8 categories, ordinal) - ~55% missing
    - educ_a2      # Adult 2 education (8 categories, ordinal) - ~51% missing
    - income       # Family income in dollars (continuous) - ~35% missing
    - family_size  # Household size (count: 1-99) - ~38% missing
    # fplcat is DERIVED from income + family_size after imputation

  # Auxiliary predictor variables (complete or from geography imputation)
  auxiliary_variables:
    - puma           # Geographic PUMA from geography imputation m
    - county         # County FIPS from geography imputation m
    - source_project # REDCap project ID (complete)
    - authentic.x    # Authenticity flag (complete)
    - age_in_days    # Child age in days (complete)
    - consent_date   # Survey completion date (complete)
    - mom_a1         # Is Adult 1 the mother? (TRUE/FALSE)
    - relation1      # Adult 1's relationship to child (6 levels)

  # Filter to eligible records only (eligible.x == TRUE, n=3,460)
  eligible_only: true

  # mice imputation methods by variable
  mice_method:
    female: "cart"      # CART for binary (TRUE/FALSE)
    raceG: "cart"       # CART for multi-level categorical
    educ_mom: "rf"      # Random Forest for ordinal (ranger)
    educ_a2: "rf"       # Random Forest for ordinal (ranger)
    income: "cart"      # CART for continuous
    family_size: "cart" # CART for count data

  # Random Forest package for method="rf"
  rf_package: "ranger"

  # Keep collinear predictors (important for geographic variables)
  remove_collinear: false

  # Maximum iterations for mice algorithm
  maxit: 20

  # Chained imputation (run mice once per geography imputation)
  # If true: run mice 5 times (m=1 each time, once per geography imputation)
  # If false: run mice once with m=5
  chained: true

# Future: Additional substantive imputation settings
substantive:
  # Variables requiring other substantive imputation methods (placeholder)
