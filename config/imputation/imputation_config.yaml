# Imputation Configuration
# Single source of truth for imputation parameters across all scripts

# Number of imputations to generate (M)
# Start small (M=5) for testing, scale up to M=20+ for production
n_imputations: 5

# Random seed for reproducibility
# Set to null for different imputations each run
random_seed: 42

# Geography imputation settings
geography:
  # Geographic variables to impute
  variables:
    - puma
    - county
    - census_tract

  # Method for sampling geography assignments
  method: "probabilistic_allocation"  # Uses afact as sampling weights

  # Minimum afact threshold to include a geography candidate
  # Set to 0 to include all possible assignments
  min_afact: 0.0

# Sociodemographic imputation settings (CART + Random Forest via mice)
sociodemographic:
  # Variables to impute
  variables:
    - female       # Child is female (binary: TRUE/FALSE) - ~39% missing
    - raceG        # Child's race/ethnicity grouped (7 categories) - ~40% missing
    - educ_mom     # Maternal education (8 categories, ordinal) - ~55% missing
    - educ_a2      # Adult 2 education (8 categories, ordinal) - ~51% missing
    - income       # Family income in dollars (continuous) - ~35% missing
    - family_size  # Household size (count: 1-99) - ~38% missing
    # fplcat is DERIVED from income + family_size after imputation

  # Auxiliary predictor variables (complete or from geography imputation)
  auxiliary_variables:
    - puma           # Geographic PUMA from geography imputation m

    - source_project # REDCap project ID (complete)
    - authentic.x    # Authenticity flag (complete)
    - age_in_days    # Child age in days (complete)
    - consent_date   # Survey completion date (complete)
    - mom_a1         # Is Adult 1 the mother? (TRUE/FALSE)
