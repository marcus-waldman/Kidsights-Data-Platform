# Important notes for sample selection
notes:
  puma_geography:
    - "5-year samples: PUMAs based on 2020 Census geography starting with 2023 5-year"
    - "Earlier samples use 2010 Census PUMA definitions"
    - "PUMA boundaries may not align across different sample periods"

  race_ethnicity_changes:
    - "2023 ACS implemented changes to race/ethnicity questions"
    - "May affect comparability with earlier years"
    - "See IPUMS documentation for harmonization guidance"

  covid_impact:
    - "2020 ACS had reduced response rates due to pandemic"
    - "2020 1-year ACS was experimental and later cancelled"
    - "Use 5-year samples for more stable estimates during this period"

  sample_size_recommendations:
    - "For state-level children 0-5: 5-year samples strongly recommended"
    - "1-year samples may have insufficient children 0-5 in smaller states"
    - "5-year samples provide ~5x larger sample size"
