# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This manual serves as the **authoritative specification** for data transformation and metadata management in the Kidsights Data Platform. It bridges the gap between research requirements and technical implementation, providing a single source of truth that both domain experts and developers can reference.

## Purpose

This manual:

1. **Documents transformation logic** for converting raw REDCap data into analysis-ready variables
2. **Specifies metadata standards** for variable documentation and categorization
3. **Guides implementation** of transformation functions in R and Python
4. **Enables collaboration** between researchers and developers through clear specifications
5. **Ensures consistency** across studies, time points, and analysis workflows

## Philosophy

**Specification-First Development:** Unlike traditional documentation that follows code, this manual is written FIRST. Code is then developed to match the specifications documented here. When discrepancies arise, the manual is the authorityâ€”code must be corrected.

**Human-Readable Specifications:** Transformation rules are written in clear language that domain experts can verify, with technical details added to support implementation.

**Machine-Readable Metadata:** Alongside human documentation, structured YAML/JSON specifications enable automated code generation, validation, and documentation.

## Manual Organization

### Part I: Foundations
Core concepts, architecture, and standards that apply across all transformations.

### Part II: Variable Domains
Detailed specifications for each functional domain (eligibility, demographics, education, etc.). Each chapter follows a consistent template covering source variables, transformation rules, metadata, and validation.

### Part III: Transformation Specifications
Technical patterns for handling factors, missing data, harmonization, and other cross-cutting concerns.

### Part IV: Implementation Guide
Guidelines for developers implementing transformations, writing tests, and contributing to the manual.

## Current System Overview

The Kidsights Data Platform processes data from **4 REDCap projects** containing **1,880 raw variables** from **3,906 participants**. Through documented transformations, it produces **21 derived variables** optimized for statistical analysis.

### Key Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| REDCap Projects | 4 (PIDs: 7679, 7943, 7999, 8014) |
| Raw Variables | 1,880 |
| Unique Variables | 472 |
| Derived Variables | 21 |
| Variable Domains | 7 |
| Studies Harmonized | NE25, NE22, NE20, CREDI, GSED, CAHMI |

### Transformation Categories

The 21 derived variables span 7 transformation categories:

1. **Eligibility** (3 variables): `eligible`, `authentic`, `include`
2. **Race/Ethnicity** (6 variables): Child and caregiver race/ethnicity combinations
3. **Education** (12 variables): 8/4/6-category education levels for multiple caregivers
4. **Demographics** (varies): Age, sex, family composition
5. **Income** (varies): Income levels, federal poverty calculations
6. **Relationships** (varies): Caregiver relationships and roles
7. **Geography** (varies): Location and residence variables

## How to Use This Manual

**For Domain Experts:**
Read Part II chapters for your domain. Verify transformation logic matches research requirements. Propose changes through contribution templates.

**For Developers:**
Use Part II specifications to implement transformation functions. Reference Part III for technical patterns. Follow Part IV guidelines for coding standards.

**For Data Analysts:**
Part II provides complete variable documentation including factor levels, reference categories, and appropriate usage guidance.

**For Project Managers:**
Part I explains the overall system. Use this manual to coordinate between research and technical teams.

## Version Control

This manual is version-controlled alongside code. Each variable specification includes:

- **Version number**: Semantic versioning for specification changes
- **Change log**: History of modifications and rationale
- **Implementation status**: Whether code matches current specification
- **Review status**: Approval by domain experts and technical leads

## Getting Started

New to the manual? Start here:

1. Read @sec-overview for system philosophy and architecture
2. Review @sec-standards for naming conventions and coding standards
3. Explore one domain chapter (Education @sec-education is a good example)
4. See @sec-contribution for how to propose new transformations

## Maintenance

This manual is a **living document**. As research needs evolve and new studies are added, specifications are updated through a formal review process documented in @sec-contribution.

**Current Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** `r Sys.Date()`
**Maintainer:** Kidsights Data Team
