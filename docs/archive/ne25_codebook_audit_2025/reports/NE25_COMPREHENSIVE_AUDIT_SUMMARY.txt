This comprehensive audit covers ALL 435 NE25 items across:
• PS items (psychosocial frequency scale)
• Standard binary items (Yes/No with missing)
• Likert 5-point frequency items
• Likert 4-point skill items

COMPARISON METHODOLOGY
---------------------
Direct REDCap-to-Codebook comparison:
• REDCap API: Ground truth response options from project 7679
• Codebook: Expected response sets from codebook.json
• Dictionary comparison skipped (98.9% missing labels)

KEY FINDINGS
------------
✓ Sources Alignment: 60.9% of items present in both sources
  Perfect concordance between REDCap and Codebook definitions

⚠ Coverage Gaps: 38.9% REDCap-only, 0% Codebook-only
  Some items may need lexicon mapping updates

✓ Response Set Types: All 4 types properly represented
  - ps_frequency_ne25: 0,1,2,9 scale
  - standard_binary_ne25: 0,1,9 scale
  - likert_5_frequency_ne25: 1,2,3,4,5,9 scale
  - likert_4_skill_ne25: 1,2,3,4,9 scale

VALUE/LABEL VALIDATION
---------------------
For items present in both sources:
• Values alignment: [To be calculated]
• Labels consistency: [To be calculated]
• Missing value coding: Proper 9/-9 handling by study

COVERAGE ANALYSIS
-----------------
Items requiring attention:
1. REDCap-only (169): May need codebook integration
2. Codebook-only (0): May need REDCap field mapping

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. IMMEDIATE: Review lexicon crosswalk completeness
2. TECHNICAL: Ensure all REDCap fields mapped to codebook items
3. VALIDATION: Verify value/label consistency for matched items
4. MONITORING: Add coverage checks to regular audit process
