# Missing Data Audit & Remediation Plan
**Created:** October 1, 2025
**Completed:** October 3, 2025
**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE
**Priority:** CRITICAL (RESOLVED)

## Context

During implementation of child ACE variables to the NE25 transformation pipeline, a critical data quality issue was discovered: **"Prefer not to answer" responses (coded as 99) are not being converted to missing/NA values** in caregiver ACE variables.

### Problem Statement

Caregiver ACE variables (cace1-10) include a "Prefer not to answer" option coded as `99`. The current transformation logic directly copies these numeric values without recoding, leading to:
- Invalid total scores (e.g., `ace_total = 990` for someone who declined all 10 items)
- Incorrect risk categorization
- Inflated composite scores being treated as valid data

### Impact Assessment

**Confirmed Issues:**
- At least **72 records** with `ace_neglect = 99` (should be NA)
- At least **56 records** with `ace_parent_loss = 99` (should be NA)
- Invalid `ace_total` scores: 495, 299, 892, 990, etc.
- Unknown extent across all 10 caregiver ACE variables

**Potentially Affected Variables:**
- Caregiver ACEs (cace1-10) - **CONFIRMED ISSUE**
- Child ACEs (cqr017-024) - Status unknown
- Mental health screening (PHQ-2, GAD-2) - Status unknown
- Childcare variables - Status unknown
- Income variables - Commonly use 999/9999 for missing
- Other derived variables with composite scores

### Files Involved

- **Primary:** `R/transform/ne25_transforms.R` (lines 978-1021 for caregiver ACEs)
- **Configuration:** `config/derived_variables.yaml`
- **Documentation:** `R/transform/README.md`
- **Database:** `ne25_transformed` table in DuckDB

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Missing Data Audit

**Goal:** Identify all variables with "Prefer not to answer" or "Don't know" options

### 1.1 Survey All Mental Health/ACE Variables

- [ ] Query REDCap data dictionary for all response options containing "99", "-99", "Prefer", "Don't know"
- [ ] Create inventory of affected variables with actual response codes:
  - [ ] Caregiver ACEs (cace1-10) - Document which use 99 vs -99
  - [ ] Child ACEs (cqr017-024) - Check if any have prefer not to answer option
  - [ ] PHQ-2 items (cqfb013-014) - Check for don't know options
  - [ ] GAD-2 items (cqfb015-016) - Check for don't know options
- [ ] Document findings in table format (variable, missing code, frequency)

### 1.2 Survey Other Derived Variable Categories

- [ ] Childcare variables (mmi*) - Check for prefer not to answer (likely 9 or 99)
- [ ] Income variables (cqr006, fqlive1_*) - Check for 999, 9999, etc.
- [ ] Education variables (cqr004, nschj017) - Check for missing codes
- [ ] Race/ethnicity variables - Check for missing codes
- [ ] Geographic variables (ZIP codes) - Check for invalid codes (00000, 99999)

### 1.3 Check Raw Data Values

- [ ] For each variable with documented missing codes, query distinct values in `ne25_raw`
- [ ] Create frequency table for each affected variable showing:
  - Valid values (e.g., 0, 1 for ACEs)
  - Missing codes (e.g., 99)
  - NULL/NA values
  - Unexpected values
- [ ] Calculate percentage of responses that are "Prefer not to answer"

### 1.4 Check Transformed Data Impact

- [ ] For each affected variable, verify if missing codes persist in `ne25_transformed`
- [ ] Check impact on composite scores:
  - [ ] `ace_total` - How many records have inflated scores (>10)?
  - [ ] `child_ace_total` - Check for any issues
  - [ ] `phq2_total` - Check for values >6
  - [ ] `gad2_total` - Check for values >6
  - [ ] Any childcare composite scores
- [ ] Document how many records have invalid total scores due to this issue

### 1.5 Phase 1 Completion

- [ ] Review this markdown file and mark completed Phase 1 tasks
- [ ] Create summary report of audit findings
- [ ] Load Phase 2 tasks into Claude TodoWrite tool
- [ ] Decision point: Proceed to Phase 2 or adjust plan based on findings

## Phase 2: Fix Missing Data Recoding ✓ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Implement systematic missing data handling across all transformations

### 2.1 Create Missing Data Cleaning Infrastructure ✓

- [x] Create `recode_missing()` helper function in `ne25_transforms.R`
  - Parameters: variable vector, missing codes (default: `c(9, 99, -99, 999, 9999)`)
  - Returns: vector with missing codes converted to NA
  - Add roxygen documentation
- [x] Test function with known data containing 99 values
- [x] Verify function preserves valid values (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)

### 2.2 Fix Caregiver ACE Transformation (URGENT) ✓

- [x] Update caregiver ACE block in `ne25_transforms.R` (around line 978)
- [x] Add missing data recoding BEFORE copying cace* → ace_* variables using `recode_missing()` helper function
- [x] Verify `ace_total` calculation uses `na.rm = FALSE` (already correct)
- [x] Verify `ace_risk_cat` properly handles records with missing ACE items
- [x] Add code comments explaining missing value handling

### 2.3 Fix Child ACE Transformation (Defensive) ✓

- [x] Update child ACE block in `ne25_transforms.R` (around line 1023)
- [x] Add missing data recoding for cqr017-024 even if not currently needed
- [x] Use same pattern as caregiver ACEs with `recode_missing()` helper
- [x] Verify `child_ace_total` calculation
- [x] Add code comments

### 2.4 Update Mental Health Transformation ✓

- [x] Check PHQ-2/GAD-2 items (cqfb013-016) for any missing codes in data dictionary
- [x] Phase 1 audit confirmed NO missing codes in PHQ-2/GAD-2 (valid 0-3 scale only)
- [x] Verify total scores (`phq2_total`, `gad2_total`) only include valid 0-3 values
- [x] Verify risk categories properly handle missing items

### 2.5 Update Income Transformation ✓

- [x] Check `cqr006` (income) for missing codes (likely 999999 or similar)
- [x] Check `fqlive1_1`, `fqlive1_2` (family size) for missing codes (likely 999)
- [x] Verified: Current code already checks `fqlive1_* < 999` which handles this correctly
- [x] Verify FPL calculations handle missing income/family size appropriately
- [x] No changes needed - existing code is correct

### 2.6 Update Childcare Transformation ✓

- [x] Review childcare variables (mmi*) for missing codes
- [x] Phase 1 audit found mmihl002 has 99 values BUT it's not used in transformations
- [x] Factor variables already handle missing (9) as factor level "Missing"
- [x] Numeric cost variables (mrw002, mmi003, etc.) - no systematic missing codes found
- [x] No changes needed - childcare transformations are correct

### 2.7 Review Other Transformations ✓

- [x] Education - Phase 1 audit confirmed NO missing codes in cqr004, nschj017
- [x] Race/ethnicity - NO missing codes found
- [x] Geographic - ZIP codes handled correctly (no 00000, 99999)
- [x] Age - NO invalid age values found
- [x] Sex - NO missing codes found

### 2.8 Phase 2 Completion ✓

- [x] Review this markdown file and mark completed Phase 2 tasks
- [x] Run full pipeline - completed successfully, no syntax errors

## Notes & Decisions

### 2025-10-01: Initial Discovery
- Found during child ACE variable implementation
- Caregiver ACEs confirmed to have 99 values persisting in transformed data
- Sample records show ace_total values of 495, 299, 892, 990 (clearly invalid)
- Issue affects risk categorization and any analyses using ACE scores

### 2025-10-03: Fix Implemented and Validated

**Changes Made:**
1. Created `recode_missing()` helper function in `ne25_transforms.R` (lines 264-286)
2. Updated caregiver ACE transformation to use `recode_missing(dat[[old_name]], missing_codes = c(99))`
3. Added defensive recoding for child ACE variables (future-proofing)
4. Re-ran full pipeline successfully

**Validation Results:**
- Zero records with ace_total > 10 (was 254+ with values 99-990) ✓
- 2,196 records properly have ace_total = NULL (declined responses or not asked)
- All ACE scores now fall within valid 0-10 range
- ACE risk category distribution shows realistic pattern (most common: "No ACEs")

**Files Modified:**
- `R/transform/ne25_transforms.R` (added recode_missing(), updated ACE transformations)
- `docs/fixes/missing_data_audit_2025_10.md` (this file - Phase 2 marked complete)

**Before/After Report:** `scripts/temp/ace_fix_before_after_comparison.md`

### Decision Log
- **Why na.rm = FALSE in rowSums?** Preserves missingness - if any ACE item is missing, total should be NA. This is correct behavior once 99 is properly coded as NA.
- **Why not use na.rm = TRUE?** Would create invalid totals (e.g., 9 valid items = 1, 1 missing → total = 1, interpreted as low ACEs when actually unknown)
- **Why defensive recoding for child ACEs?** Even though no current missing codes, protects against future survey changes
