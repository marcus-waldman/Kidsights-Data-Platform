## Usage Notes

### Variable Naming Conventions

NSCH uses several prefixes to organize variables:

- `SC_*` - Selected Child demographics (age, sex, race, etc.)
- `A1_*` - Adult 1 (primary caregiver) information
- `A2_*` - Adult 2 (secondary caregiver) information
- `K2Q*` - Health conditions and status
- `K4Q*` - Healthcare access and insurance
- `K5Q*` - Healthcare quality and utilization
- `K6Q*` - Family functioning and activities
- `K7Q*` - Parenting and discipline
- `K8Q*` - Neighborhood characteristics
- `K9Q*` - School experiences
- `K10Q*` - Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)
- `K11Q*` - Additional health and development items

### Querying Variables

To find variables in the database:

```python
import duckdb

conn = duckdb.connect('data/duckdb/kidsights_local.duckdb')

# Find all ACE variables in 2023
ace_vars = conn.execute("""
    SELECT variable_name, variable_label
    FROM nsch_variables
    WHERE year = 2023
      AND variable_name LIKE 'K10Q%'
    ORDER BY variable_name
""").fetchdf()

print(ace_vars)

conn.close()
```

### Value Labels

To see response options for a variable:

```python
import duckdb

conn = duckdb.connect('data/duckdb/kidsights_local.duckdb')

# Get value labels for SC_SEX in 2023
labels = conn.execute("""
    SELECT value, label
    FROM nsch_value_labels
    WHERE year = 2023
      AND variable_name = 'SC_SEX'
    ORDER BY value
""").fetchdf()

print(labels)

conn.close()
```

### Cross-Year Harmonization

When using variables across multiple years:

1. **Check value labels:** Response options may differ across years
2. **Verify skip patterns:** Universe and skip logic may have changed
3. **Review question wording:** Item text may have been revised
4. **Test for consistency:** Run cross-year validation queries
