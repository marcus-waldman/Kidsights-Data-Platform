# Imputation Pipeline Test Report

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Test Type:** Full pipeline fresh run
**Study:** Nebraska 2025 (ne25)
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

---

## Test Summary

The complete imputation pipeline was tested from scratch with all database tables cleared and re-populated. **All stages completed successfully with zero errors.**

### Execution Time
- **Total Runtime:** 122.6 seconds (2.0 minutes)
- **M Imputations:** 5
- **Total Variables:** 14 (3 geography + 7 sociodem + 4 childcare)

### Stage Performance

| Stage | Component | Time (sec) | Status |
|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Geography Imputation | 3.2 | ✅ |
| 2 | Sociodemographic Imputation | 96.9 | ✅ |
| 3 | Sociodem DB Insert | 6.0 | ✅ |
| 4 | Childcare Stage 1 (receives_care) | 5.3 | ✅ |
| 5 | Childcare Stage 2 (type + hours) | 7.3 | ✅ |
| 6 | Childcare Stage 3 (derived) | 0.4 | ✅ |
| 7 | Childcare DB Insert | 3.6 | ✅ |

## Validation Results

### 1. Helper Module Validation ✅
```
[OK] Metadata table has 14 variables
[OK] All 14 variables validated
     - No NULL values found
     - All childcare values within valid ranges
     - No duplicate records
[OK] Childcare imputations retrieved: 4,900 records
[OK] Complete dataset retrieved: 4,900 records, 14 imputed variables
```

### 2. Statistical Diagnostics ✅

**Imputed vs Observed Proportions:**
- childcare_10hrs_nonfamily: 49.7% prevalence (stable across M)
- cc_hours_per_week: Mean 31.8-32.1 hours (cleaned, no outliers)

**Variance Across Imputations:**
- Imputed values show 50% variation (appropriate)
- Derived variables show expected constancy

**Predictor Relationships:**
- Geographic variation: 35% to 60% by PUMA
- Income gradient: 27% (low) → 47% (high)
- Sex differences: Minimal (not significant)

**Plausibility Checks:**
- Hours range: 0-95 hours ✅ (0 outliers >168)
- Valid categories: All 6 types present ✅
- Logical consistency: 0 violations ✅

## Key Quality Checks

### ✅ Data Cleaning Success
- 1 outlier detected (15,000 hours) and removed before imputation
- Data cleaning logic in `03b_impute_cc_type_hours.R` (lines 149-166) working correctly
- No impossible values propagated through mice PMM

### ✅ Defensive Programming
- NULL filtering active in all stages
- Space-efficient design: only imputed values stored (no NULLs)
- Conditional imputation logic maintained (type/hours only for "Yes" responses)

### ✅ Statistical Validity
- Imputations vary appropriately (not identical)
- Strong predictor relationships (geography, income effects)
- Proportions stable across M imputations
- Convergence successful (no warnings)

## Conclusion

✅ **The imputation pipeline is production-ready and runs flawlessly from scratch.**

**Key Achievements:**
1. Complete end-to-end execution without errors
2. All validation checks pass
3. Statistical diagnostics confirm validity
4. Data quality issues resolved (outlier cleaning)
