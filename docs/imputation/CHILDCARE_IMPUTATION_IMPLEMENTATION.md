# Childcare Imputation Implementation Plan

**Objective:** Add childcare variables as a 3-stage sequential imputation process to derive final outcome: childcare ≥10 hours/week from non-family member.

**Method:** Sequential chained imputation with conditional logic

**Imputation Stages:**
1. **Stage 1:** Impute `cc_receives_care` (Yes/No) - 14.2% missing
2. **Stage 2:** Conditional imputation of `cc_primary_type` and `cc_hours_per_week` (only for cc_receives_care = "Yes")
3. **Stage 3:** Derive `childcare_10hrs_nonfamily` from completed cc_primary_type + cc_hours_per_week

**Auxiliary Variables:** PUMA (geography) + authentic.x (base data) + 7 sociodemographic variables

**Eligibility:** Filter to `eligible.x == TRUE` only (3,460 of 3,908 records)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Production Ready (October 7, 2025)
