# CART Imputation Pipeline - Implementation Plan

**Created:** October 2025
**Purpose:** Extend geographic imputation pipeline to include sociodemographic variables using CART method via R `mice` package

---

## Overview

Extend the geographic imputation pipeline to include **sociodemographic variables** using **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)** method via the R `mice` package. This will create M=5 imputations for missing values in child and family characteristics.

### Unified Pipeline Design

**Single Command Execution:** The complete imputation pipeline runs as a unified workflow via `scripts/imputation/run_full_imputation_pipeline.R`.

**Two-Stage Sequential Process:**

**Stage 1: Geographic Imputation (Python)**
```
Script: scripts/imputation/01_impute_geography.py
Method: Probabilistic allocation using afact (allocation factors)
Output: 5 imputations for puma, county, census_tract
Runtime: ~2-3 seconds
```

**Stage 2: Sociodemographic Imputation (R)**
```
Script: scripts/imputation/02_impute_sociodemographic.R
Method: CART + Random Forest via mice package

For each geography imputation m in 1:5:
  1. Load base data + imputed geography from imputation m (puma, county)
  2. Filter to eligible records only (eligible.x=TRUE)
  3. Run mice(m=1, method=cart/rf) using geography as fixed predictors
  4. Calculate derived FPL category from imputed income + family_size
  5. Store sociodem imputation m to database

Runtime: ~5-10 minutes (mice with CART/RF on 3,460 records Ã— 5 iterations)
```

**Result:** Each of 5 imputations has **internally consistent** geography and sociodemographic values. If person lives in wealthy PUMA in imputation 3, their income/education reflects that context.

## Variables to Impute (6 total)

### From `ne25_transformed` table (ELIGIBLE RECORDS ONLY):

**IMPORTANT:** Imputation will only be performed on records where `eligible.x = TRUE` (n=3,460 records, 70.6% of dataset). Ineligible records will be excluded from imputation.

1. **female** - Child is female (Binary: TRUE/FALSE)
   - Current missingness: 39.4% (1,929 / 4,900 total, ~14.5% among eligible)
   - Type: Binary logical
   - Method: CART

2. **raceG** - Child's race/ethnicity grouped (Factor: 7 categories)
   - Categories: White non-Hisp., AIAN non-Hisp., Asian/PI non-Hisp., Black non-Hisp., Hispanic, Other non-Hisp., Two or More non-Hisp.
   - Current missingness: 40.0% (1,961 / 4,900 total, TBD among eligible)
   - Type: Nominal categorical
   - Method: CART

3. **educ_mom** - Maternal education (Factor: 8 categories)
   - Current missingness: 55.0% (2,696 / 4,900 total, TBD among eligible)
   - Type: Ordinal categorical
   - Method: Random Forest (ranger)

4. **educ_a2** - Adult 2 (secondary caregiver/father) education (Factor: 8 categories)
   - Current missingness: 51.3% (2,513 / 4,900 total, TBD among eligible)
   - Type: Ordinal categorical
   - Method: Random Forest (ranger)

5. **income** - Family income (Numeric: dollars)
   - Current missingness: 35.3% (1,732 / 4,900 total, TBD among eligible)
   - Type: Continuous
   - Method: CART

6. **family_size** - Household size (Numeric: 1-99)
   - Current missingness: 38.2% (1,874 / 4,900 total, TBD among eligible)
   - Type: Count
   - Method: CART

### Derived After Imputation:

7. **fplcat** - Federal Poverty Level category (Factor: 5 levels)
   - Calculated from imputed `income` and `family_size`
   - Current missingness: 38.6% (1,893 / 4,900)
   - Formula: `fpl = (income / federal_poverty_threshold(family_size)) * 100`

---

## Auxiliary Variables (Predictors)

**Include in imputation models but do NOT impute:**

1. **puma** - Geographic PUMA (from geography imputation m, varies by imputation)
2. **county** - County FIPS code (from geography imputation m, varies by imputation)
3. **source_project** - Project ID (redcap_pid: 7679, 7943, 7999, 8014)
4. **authentic.x** - Authenticity flag (Logical: TRUE/FALSE)
5. **age_in_days** - Child age in days (continuous, complete data)
6. **consent_date** - Survey date (for temporal patterns, complete data)
7. **mom_a1** - Is Adult 1 the mother? (Logical: TRUE/FALSE, 36% missing)
8. **relation1** - Adult 1's relationship to child (Factor: 6 levels, 36% missing)

**Note:** `eligible.x` is used to FILTER the dataset (only eligible=TRUE records are imputed), not as a predictor.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. CART + Random Forest Methods
**Decision:** Use CART for categorical/continuous, Random Forest for ordinal variables
**Rationale:**
- **CART** (female, raceG, income, family_size): Fast, interpretable, works well for binary/nominal/continuous
- **Random Forest** (educ_mom, educ_a2): Ensemble method, better for ordinal variables
  - Averages many trees â†’ more stable predictions
  - Handles ordinality implicitly through aggregation
  - Ranger package provides fast C++ implementation
  - No proportional odds assumptions (unlike polr)
- Both methods are nonparametric (no distributional assumptions)

### 2. Eligible Records Only
**Decision:** Only impute records where `eligible.x = TRUE` (n=3,460, 70.6% of dataset)
**Rationale:**
- Ineligible records (failed screening criteria) are not part of analysis population
- Saves computational resources (30% fewer records to impute)
- Cleaner imputation models (focus on analysis-relevant population)
- Authenticity used as predictor (some eligible records are suspicious but retained)

### 3. Chained Imputation Approach
**Decision:** Run mice 5 times (once per geography imputation m), not once with m=5
**Rationale:**
- Creates within-imputation consistency between geography and sociodemographics
- Geography values from imputation m serve as FIXED auxiliary variables for sociodem imputation m
- Each imputation represents a jointly plausible "world" (geography + sociodem together)
- Proper MI framework: each imputation captures uncertainty in ALL variables consistently

### 4. Selective Storage
**Decision:** Only store records where original value was missing
**Rationale:** Consistency with geography imputation, 50%+ storage efficiency

### 5. FPL Derivation
**Decision:** Calculate after imputation, store as separate variable
**Rationale:** FPL is deterministic function of income + family_size, ensure consistency across imputations

### 6. Geography as Fixed Auxiliary
**Decision:** Include puma, county from imputation m as predictors (not re-imputed)
**Rationale:** Geography already imputed in Phase 1, use those values to inform sociodem imputation

### 7. Maternal + Secondary Caregiver Education
**Decision:** Impute `educ_mom` and `educ_a2` (not educ_a1)
**Rationale:**
- `educ_mom` = mother's education (specific parental variable)
- `educ_a2` = secondary caregiver education (father/partner when available)
- Captures **parental** education rather than respondent education
- More relevant for child outcomes research

### 8. Keep Collinear Predictors
**Decision:** Use `remove.collinear=FALSE` in mice() call
**Rationale:**
- By default, mice removes collinear predictors to avoid singularity issues
- However, collinear variables (e.g., mom_a1 and educ_mom, puma and county) provide useful information
- CART and RF can handle collinearity without problems (unlike regression-based methods)
- Keeping all predictors improves imputation quality

### 9. Relationship Variables as Predictors
**Decision:** Include `mom_a1` and `relation1` as auxiliary variables
**Rationale:**
- `mom_a1` indicates if Adult 1 is the mother (helps link educ_a1 to educ_mom)
- `relation1` captures relationship type (biological parent, grandparent, foster, etc.)
- Both variables may predict education/income patterns (e.g., grandparents vs. parents)
- 36% missing is acceptable for auxiliary variables in mice

### 10. Multiple Seeds
**Decision:** Use seed+m for each geography imputation (seed+1, seed+2, ..., seed+5)
**Rationale:** Different random draws for each imputation while maintaining reproducibility

---

## Integration with Geography Imputations

**Chained Approach (IMPLEMENTED):**
- Geography: M=5 imputations created first via probabilistic allocation (Phase 1, already complete)
- Sociodemographic: For each geography imputation m, run `mice(m=1)` with that geography as auxiliary
- Result: Imputation m has **internally consistent** geography and sociodem values

**How it Works:**
```
Imputation 1:
  - Person A: puma=00802 (from geography imputation 1) â†’ sociodem imputed using puma=00802
  - Person B: puma=00901 (from geography imputation 1) â†’ sociodem imputed using puma=00901

Imputation 2:
  - Person A: puma=00801 (from geography imputation 2) â†’ sociodem imputed using puma=00801
  - Person B: puma=00901 (from geography imputation 2) â†’ sociodem imputed using puma=00901
```

**Advantages:**
- Geography and sociodem **jointly plausible** within each imputation
- Geographic context improves sociodem imputation quality
- Proper MI variance estimation (all uncertainty captured)
- Maintains separate storage (3 geography + 7 sociodem = 10 tables)
- Can re-run sociodem imputation without re-running geography

"C:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.1\bin\Rscript.exe" scripts/imputation/run_full_imputation_pipeline.R
```

**This executes:**
1. Stage 1: Geographic imputation (Python via reticulate) - ~2-3 seconds
2. Stage 2: Sociodemographic imputation (R mice) - ~5-10 minutes
3. Total runtime: ~5-10 minutes for M=5 imputations

**Manual Two-Stage Execution (Alternative):**
```bash
# Stage 1: Geography
python scripts/imputation/01_impute_geography.py

# Stage 2: Sociodemographic
"C:\Program Files\R\R-4.5.1\bin\Rscript.exe" scripts/imputation/02_impute_sociodemographic.R
```

## Storage Estimates

### Current (Geography Only):
- 3 tables: `imputed_puma`, `imputed_county`, `imputed_census_tract`
- 25,483 rows total

### After CART Implementation:
- 10 tables total (3 geography + 7 sociodem)
- Estimated new rows:
  - `imputed_female`: 1,929 records Ã— 5 imputations = 9,645 rows
  - `imputed_raceG`: 1,961 Ã— 5 = 9,805 rows
  - `imputed_educ_a2`: 2,513 Ã— 5 = 12,565 rows
  - `imputed_educ_a1`: 1,752 Ã— 5 = 8,760 rows
  - `imputed_income`: 1,732 Ã— 5 = 8,660 rows
  - `imputed_family_size`: 1,874 Ã— 5 = 9,370 rows
  - `imputed_fplcat`: 1,893 Ã— 5 = 9,465 rows
- **Sociodem total:** 68,270 rows
- **Grand total:** 25,483 + 68,270 = **93,753 rows** across 10 tables

## Summary: Variables Being Imputed vs Auxiliary Variables

### Variables Being Imputed (6 sociodemographic + 1 derived)

**THESE HAVE MISSING VALUES AND WILL BE IMPUTED USING CART:**

1. **female** - Child is female (Binary: TRUE/FALSE) - ~39% missing among eligible
   - Method: **CART**
2. **raceG** - Child's race/ethnicity grouped (7 categories) - ~40% missing among eligible
   - Method: **CART**
3. **educ_mom** - Maternal education (8 categories, ordinal) - ~55% missing among eligible
   - Method: **Random Forest (ranger)**
4. **educ_a2** - Adult 2 (secondary caregiver/father) education (8 categories, ordinal) - ~51% missing among eligible
   - Method: **Random Forest (ranger)**
5. **income** - Family income in dollars (continuous) - ~35% missing among eligible
   - Method: **CART**
6. **family_size** - Household size (count: 1-99) - ~38% missing among eligible
   - Method: **CART**
7. **fplcat** - Federal Poverty Level category (5 levels, derived from income + family_size)
   - Method: **Calculated post-imputation**

**Population:** Only eligible records (eligible.x=TRUE, n=3,460, 70.6% of dataset)
**Iterations:** Run mice 5 times (once per geography imputation m)

### Auxiliary Variables (8 predictors)

**THESE ARE COMPLETE (OR IMPUTED ALREADY) AND USED AS PREDICTORS ONLY:**

1. **puma** - Geographic PUMA from geography imputation m (varies by m)
2. **county** - County FIPS from geography imputation m (varies by m)
3. **source_project** - REDCap project ID (4 values: 7679, 7943, 7999, 8014)
4. **authentic.x** - Authenticity flag (TRUE/FALSE)
5. **age_in_days** - Child age in days (continuous, complete)
6. **consent_date** - Survey completion date (date, complete)
7. **mom_a1** - Is Adult 1 the mother? (TRUE/FALSE, 36% missing)
8. **relation1** - Adult 1's relationship to child (6 levels: bio/adoptive parent, foster, grandparent, step-parent, other relative, non-relative; 36% missing)

**Note:** `eligible.x` is used to FILTER the dataset (only eligible=TRUE are imputed), NOT as a predictor

### Key Design Points

âœ… **Eligible Records Only:** Impute only where eligible.x=TRUE (n=3,460, 70.6%)
âœ… **Chained Imputation:** Run `mice` 5 times (once per geography imputation m=1:5)
âœ… **CART + Random Forest:** CART for categorical/continuous, RF for ordinal education
âœ… **Geography as Auxiliary:** Use imputed geography from each m as fixed predictors
âœ… **Within-Imputation Consistency:** Each m has jointly plausible geography + sociodem
âœ… **Selective Storage:** Only store originally missing values (50%+ efficiency)
âœ… **Derived FPL:** Calculate fplcat after imputing income and family_size
âœ… **Parental Education:** Impute educ_mom (maternal) and educ_a2 (secondary caregiver)
âœ… **Keep Collinear Predictors:** Use remove.collinear=FALSE (CART/RF handle collinearity)
âœ… **Relationship Predictors:** Include mom_a1 and relation1 for better predictions
