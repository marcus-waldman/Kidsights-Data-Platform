# Pipeline Status Report - September 17, 2025

## Debug Session Summary

Tonight's debugging session successfully resolved critical issues with the NE25 pipeline, particularly the CID8 function that was completely failing. The pipeline now processes data much more reliably.

## ✅ FIXES COMPLETED

### 1. **CID8 Function - MAJOR FIX**
**Status**: Now working correctly after being completely broken
- **Items Found**: 187 quality items (was 0)
- **Participants Processed**: 2,308 pass authenticity check (59% pass rate)
- **Processing**: 2,342 participants with 340 columns for IRT analysis

**Technical Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed namespace conflicts with explicit `dplyr::` prefixes
- Fixed critical data flow issue in pivot_wider logic
- Added comprehensive debugging statements throughout function

### 2. **extract_value_labels Function**
**Status**: Confirmed working correctly
- Successfully parses REDCap choice strings (e.g., 93 Nebraska counties)
- str_split_1 operations working as expected
- Added caching mechanism for rapid debugging

### 3. **Module Completion Check**
**Status**: Fixed str_split_1 error
- Replaced problematic `rowwise() %>% str_split_1()` approach
- Implemented vectorized `str_extract()` solution
- Resolved concatenated vector issue in name column

## ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUES

### 1. **Pipeline Failure After CID8**
- CID8 completes successfully but pipeline fails before apply_ne25_eligibility
- Error occurs between eligibility validation and data application steps
- apply_ne25_eligibility debug statements never appear in output

### 2. **CID8 IRT Analysis - NEEDS INVESTIGATION**
**Error**: "item categories must start with 0 ... some items may be constant"
- **Current Behavior**: Function gracefully falls back to simplified scoring (working)
- **Investigation Needed**: Why some items don't have proper 0-based categories
- **Potential Issues**:
  - Response coding (1,2,3 vs 0,1,2) mismatch
  - Missing response categories in actual data
  - Constant value items that should be filtered out
  - Codebook vs actual data discrepancies

## 📊 CURRENT METRICS

- **Total Records**: 3,907 participants
- **CID8 Items Found**: 226 total items
- **Quality Items**: 187 items pass all criteria (Kobs > 1, SDobs > 0.05, Nobs >= 30, MINobs == 0)
- **Authenticity Pass Rate**: 59% (2,308/3,907 participants)
- **Pipeline Timeout**: Extended to 10 minutes (600000ms) - working well

## 🔧 DEBUG APPROACH ESTABLISHED

### Cached Test Data Strategy
Created standalone test scripts for rapid debugging:
- `scripts/temp/test_cid8_standalone.R` - Tests CID8 with cached inputs
- `scripts/temp/test_value_labels_standalone.R` - Tests extract_value_labels function
- Saves test data to `temp/` directories for reuse
- Eliminates need to re-run REDCap API calls during debugging

### Debugging Best Practices Developed
- Use explicit namespace prefixes for all dplyr functions
- Add comprehensive debug print statements throughout complex functions
- Cache function inputs for iterative debugging
- Use 10-minute timeouts for full pipeline runs

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1: Investigate CID8 IRT Categories
- Examine actual response values in the 187 quality items
- Check for 0-based vs 1-based coding discrepancies
- Verify if simplified scoring vs IRT gives substantially different results
- Consider if codebook response mappings need adjustment

### Priority 2: Complete Pipeline Debug
- Find and fix the failure point between CID8 and apply_ne25_eligibility
- Ensure complete end-to-end pipeline execution
- Validate final eligibility counts and derived variables

### Priority 3: Production Validation
- Run complete pipeline end-to-end without errors
- Verify all 21 derived variables are created correctly
- Confirm ~2,255 participants meet final eligibility criteria

## 💾 FILES MODIFIED
- `R/harmonize/ne25_eligibility.R` - Major fixes to CID8 function and apply_ne25_eligibility
- Created multiple test scripts in `scripts/temp/`
- Enhanced debugging throughout eligibility validation functions
