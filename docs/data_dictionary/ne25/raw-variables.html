We're inviting you to take a survey for research. <\/span><\/h6> <h6><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">We are looking for caregivers of young children, from birth through age five, to complete a new survey, the Global Scale for Early Development, to help us understand how to measure early childhood development and understand the health and development of Nebraska's young children.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">The researchers leading this study are Dr. Abbie Raikes, College of Public Health, and Dr. Jolene Johnson, Munroe-Meyer Institute, University of Nebraska Medical Center.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">We're inviting you to take a survey for research. This survey is completely voluntary. There are no negative consequences if you don't want to take it. If you start the survey, you can always change your mind and stop at any time.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">The purpose of this study is to understand young children's health and development and how their families are doing in Nebraska. We are interested in learning how families handle childcare arrangements and home environments for young children. This survey will ask questions about your child's development focused on things that many young children do, such as learning to walk, talk and handle their feelings. The survey has questions about how you are feeling as a parent or caregiver, how your family is handling costs for housing, food and childcare, and what type of activities you can do with your child each week. The survey takes about 20 minutes to complete.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;\">Risks:<\/span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">1.
